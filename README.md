## Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large-scale Netflix dataset containing 17,000+ movies and 17 million+ user ratings. The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about user behavior, rating patterns, and content performance that can support data-driven decision-making and recommendation systems.

The analysis highlights trends in user engagement, rating consistency, and popular content using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

# 📊 Dataset Description

The project uses two main datasets:

- Movies Dataset – Contains movie titles, release years, and genres.

- Ratings Dataset – Contains user ratings for movies.

Key Attributes:

- Movie Name

- Release Year

- User ID

- Rating

- Rating Timestamp

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas – Data manipulation & cleaning

- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

- NumPy – Numerical operations

- Jupyter Notebook – Analysis & visualization

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Loaded and merged large datasets efficiently

- Handled missing values and formatting issues

- Prepared data for analysis and visualization

2️⃣ Rating Distribution Analysis

- Analyzed overall rating trends

- Identified how ratings are distributed across users

- Observed patterns in user engagement and rating frequency

3️⃣ User Rating Variance Analysis

- Calculated rating variance per user

Identified:

- Low-variance users → consistent preferences

- High-variance users → unpredictable rating behavior

- Insights useful for recommendation system design

4️⃣ Popular & Top-Rated Movies

- Identified movies with:

- Highest number of ratings

- Highest average ratings

- Analyzed audience preferences across different content types

5️⃣ Visualization & Insights

- Histogram of rating variance

- Distribution of movie ratings

- Popularity analysis of movies

- Clear visual storytelling using plots

📈 Key Insights

- Most users show low to moderate rating variance, indicating stable preferences.

- A small group of users exhibits high rating variability, requiring advanced recommendation strategies.

- Popular movies tend to have more consistent ratings.

- Rating behavior insights can improve personalized recommendation systems.

🚀 Project Outcomes

- Built strong understanding of user behavior analysis

- Gained hands-on experience in EDA on large datasets

Generated insights useful for:

- Recommendation engines

- Content ranking

- User segmentation
